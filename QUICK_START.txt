## 🚀 STEP-BY-STEP SETUP (Windows + VS Code)

### Step 1: Prerequisites
You need Node.js installed.

**Check if you have it:**
- Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
- Type: `node --version`
- You should see: `v18.x.x` or similar

**If you don't have Node.js:**
1. Go to: https://nodejs.org/
2. Download LTS version (18.x or 20.x)
3. Run installer, use all defaults
4. Restart your computer

### Step 2: Open Project in VS Code
1. Open VS Code
2. File → Open Folder
3. Select the project folder
4. Wait for VS Code to load

### Step 3: Open Terminal
- Press: `Ctrl + ~`
- Or: Terminal → New Terminal
- You should see a command line at bottom

### Step 4: Install Dependencies
Type:
```bash
npm install
```

This downloads React, Tailwind, Framer Motion, etc.
**WAIT 2-3 minutes for it to complete.**

You'll see lots of progress bars. That's normal.

### Step 5: Start Development Server
Type:
```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

### Step 6: Open in Browser
1. Open your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
2. Go to: `http://localhost:5173/`
3. **BOOM!** 🎉 Your healthcare website is live

## 🛠️ TROUBLESHOOTING

**"npm: command not found"**
→ Node.js not installed properly
→ Download from nodejs.org
→ Restart VS Code

**"Port 5173 already in use"**
→ Another app is using it
→ Vite will try 5174, 5175, etc automatically
→ Or close other apps

**"Module not found" error**
→ npm install didn't complete
→ Delete node_modules folder
→ Run: `npm install` again

**"Changes don't update"**
→ Vite auto-refreshes on file save
→ If stuck: Ctrl+C to stop, then `npm run dev` again

**Forms don't submit**
→ Forms work without backend (simulated)
→ Check that all required fields are filled
→ Look at browser console (F12) for errors

## 🎨 CUSTOMIZATION

- `health-50` - Light background

### Change Content
**File:** `src/pages/`

Each page has content you can customize:

- Contact information
- Hours of operation

### Change Brand Name
**File:** `src/components/Navigation.jsx` (line ~6)

Change "HealthCare+" to your hospital name

## 🌐 FORMS & EMAILJS

### Current Setup (Simulated)
- Forms show success message (simulated)
- No backend required
- Works without EmailJS configured

### Add Real Email Integration (Optional)
To send real emails via EmailJS:

1. Go to: https://emailjs.com/
2. Create free account
3. Get your Service ID, Template ID, Public Key
4. Update `src/pages/Appointment.jsx` and `src/pages/Contact.jsx`:
   ```javascript
   import emailjs from 'emailjs-com'
   
   // Initialize EmailJS
   emailjs.init('YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY')
   
   // In handleSubmit function:
   await emailjs.send('YOUR_SERVICE_ID', 'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID', {
     to_email: formData.email,
     from_name: formData.name,
     message: formData.message
   })
   ```

For now, the forms work great without this!
